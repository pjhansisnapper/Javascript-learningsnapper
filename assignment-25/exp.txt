The async/await version looks more like normal synchronous code, making it easier to understand.
When using .then(), nesting multiple .then() calls can make code hard to read. async/await keeps it flat and structured.



- We add async before the function → This tells JavaScript we will use await inside.
- await fetch(url) → Waits for fetch() to complete.
- await response.json() → Waits for JSON conversion.
- try...catch → Handles errors neatly.
