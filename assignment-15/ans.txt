The V8 JavaScript engine, developed by Google, is an open-source engine written in C++. It powers both Google Chrome and Node.js, enabling efficient execution of JavaScript code. Here are some of its key features:

-Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:
  V8 uses JIT compilation to convert JavaScript code into machine code before execution, enhancing performance.
  It employs a two-tier JIT compilation process:

-Ignition: A lightweight interpreter that quickly compiles JavaScript into bytecode.

-TurboFan: An advanced compiler that converts bytecode into native machine code for faster execution.

--Efficient Garbage Collection and Memory Management:
  V8 incorporates a robust garbage collection system that automates memory allocation and cleanup.
  It uses generational garbage collection, categorizing objects into young and old generations to optimize memory utilization.

--Support for ECMAScript and New JavaScript Features:
    V8 continuously updates to support the latest JavaScript features outlined in the ECMAScript standards.
    Features include async/await, modules, arrow functions, spread operators, and destructuring.

--Cross-Platform Compatibility:
   V8 is designed to run on various platforms, making it suitable for both web browsers and servers.
   It powers Google Chrome on the client side and Node.json the server side.

--Performance Optimization:
   V8 is written in C++ and is continuously improved for better performance.
   It is portable and runs on multiple operating systems, including Mac, Windows, and Linux.

--Compilation:
   Modern JavaScript engines, including V8, compile JavaScript code rather than just interpreting it.



The V8 engine's ability to compile JavaScript into machine code, manage memory efficiently, and support the latest JavaScript features makes it a pivotal technology in modern web development.
