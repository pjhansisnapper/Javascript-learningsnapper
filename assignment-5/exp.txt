function incrementCounter() {
    let localCount = 0; // Local variable, resets every function call
    globalCount++; // incrementing  the global variable
    localCount++; // incrementing  the local variable

    console.log(`globalCount: ${globalCount}, localCount: ${localCount}`);
}
incrementCounter();
incrementCounter();//first function call
since globalCount is declared globally globalcount gets incremented again whle local cant 
as locally is intilitialized hence results no work /modifies the localCount as fun() is called outside.

//THUS RESULTs in globalCount=2 and localCount as 1 in final print statement(console).
