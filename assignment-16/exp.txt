setTimeout is a commonly used function in JavaScript, but it comes with several potential issues.

(-----Discussed the problems and solutions for it in ans.js---)

1)Losing this Context in a Method

Issue: When using setTimeout inside an object method, this may refer to the global object instead of the object itself.

Solution: Use an arrow function to preserve this.

2)setTimeout Inside a Loop (Closure Issue)

Issue: If setTimeout is used inside a loop, it may reference the final value of the loop variable.

Solution: Use let instead of var to create a block-scoped variable

3) ** Not Being Precise**
 Issue: JavaScript is single-threaded, so if the event loop is busy, setTimeout might execute later than expected.

Solution: Avoid blocking operations and use setInterval with timestamp checks.

4) Forgetting to Clear Timeouts

Issue: If a timeout is not cleared, it may cause unintended behavior.

Solution: Always store the timeout ID and clear it if needed.

5) Creating Too Many Uncontrolled Timers

Issue: If timers are created repeatedly without proper handling, it can lead to memory leaks.

Solution: Use a counter or a flag to stop execution when necessary.
