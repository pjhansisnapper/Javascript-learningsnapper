Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language(executes line by line)that acts like brain to the web page.
Js execute code through search engine that creates an environment called the execution context.
Execution context divides into 1)creation phase 2)Exceution phase.
In creation phase js scans code and allocates memory for variables . 
In execution phase js engine executes the code line by line and updates the values of variables and executes functions.
