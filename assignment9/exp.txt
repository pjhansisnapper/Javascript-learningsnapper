Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ):A let or const variable cannot be accessed before its declaration within its scope.

-attempting to access it before declaration results in a ReferenceError.

=>Difference Between let and const:
.Both let and const have TDZ.
.let allows reassignment, while const does not.

=>Best Practices to Avoid TDZ Issues:
 -Always declare variables before using them.
 -Avoid unnecessary console logs before variable initialization.
