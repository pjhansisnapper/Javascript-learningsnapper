-> The button turns blue when clicked, and the console logs are appearing as expected. Here's whatâ€™s happening:

1) Regular Function (function() {})
this refers to the button element (<button id="btn">Click Me!</button>).
The button changes color to blue because this.style.backgroundColor = "blue"; is executed.

2)  Arrow Function (() => {})
this refers to the window object, not the button.
This is because arrow functions do not have their own this; they inherit it from their surrounding scope, which in this case is the global window object.
 - Proof from Your Console Output
 . First log (from regular function): Shows the <button> element.
 . Second log (from arrow function): Shows Window, confirming that this refers to the global scope.
 . Button turns blue on click, meaning the function is correctly applied.
