fetch() is used to make an API request, returns a promise, and correctly handles errors.

for the given snippet (example):
fetchData function worked perfectly and retrieved the data successfully.

fetch(url) → Returns a Promise (which resolves with a Response object).
.then(response => response.json()) → response.json() returns another Promise (because JSON conversion is asynchronous).
.catch(error => console.log(error.message)) → Handles errors if fetch() fails.
