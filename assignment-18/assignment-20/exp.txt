Advantages of Currying:
Reusability : Helps create specialized versions of a function by partially applying arguments.
const add2 = add(2); // Partially applied function
console.log(add2(3)(5)); // Output: 10

Function Composition : Allows creating small, modular functions that can be easily composed.

Avoiding Repetition : If a function is frequently used with the same first argument, we can fix that argument and reuse the function.

Improved Readability & Maintainability : Code becomes more declarative and easier to understand.

Better Handling of Higher-Order Functions : Currying works well with functions that take multiple arguments at different points in execution.
