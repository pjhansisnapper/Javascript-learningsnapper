A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function retains access to the outer functionâ€™s variables even after the outer function finishes executing. 
It ensures data privacy and encapsulation.

-Outer Function (createCounter): Initializes a private variable count.

-Return Value (Inner Function): The outer function returns an inner function that increments count and logs it.

-Creating the Counter: const counter = createCounter(); creates an instance of the createCounter function.

-Calling the Inner Function: Each call to counter() increments count and logs the value.
