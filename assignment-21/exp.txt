JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance, which means that objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through a prototype chain.

Prototype inheritance allows objects to reuse code efficiently.
- Methods in prototype are shared among all instances, reducing memory usage.
- Object.create(Person.prototype) links Student to Person for method inheritance.
- Prototype chain ensures JavaScript finds the correct method/property when accessed.
